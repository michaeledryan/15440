Worker:

	
Client:
	ACKs when a particular process is done.
	Should be able to display running processes.
	Can start and kill processes.

	Multiple clients are possible.

	When a client disconnects...?
	Suspend processes
	Kill processes
	On disconnect, we keep processes running.
	New clients can request the processes that belonged to the dead client??

Master:
	GET A PROCESS ID???
	


Process:
	Store ID of client and process.


Cleanup!
Heartbeats to see if we kill things?
Need to fail more gracefully - if master disconnects, do we keep workers running for a few minutes?
kill commands!!!!

client killall command?
